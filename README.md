# Landis Coding Challenge

This is my coding challenge for a full-stack developer role. Also my third full stack project. Made with HTML, CSS, Javascript.

Frameworks used: Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, EJS, Mongoose.
Database: MongoDB (deployed onto Mongo Atlas)

Code deployed onto Heroku. Check out [my project](https://warm-eyrie-02465.herokuapp.com/statistics)

PS: For some reason, I couldn't figure out how to pass EJS code to static JS files.
